Author's Project Notes

 Decided to make this to better understand what is going on in my scanning tools. 
 
 Also wanted to be more effective at LOL when I run into issues port forwarding my scan tools.
 
 This is the first time I have actually implemented 1) Classes, 2) Dictionaries, 3) Multi-Module Code Packaging. 
 
 There are some of these things present in BHAT.py, but a lot of that was the wonderful support of Mr. Hai in that project. 
 
 I barely had my head above water when troubleshooting that script. Admittedly, I barely have my head above water writing 
 
 this script either, but I have implemented everything myself this time so counting it as MY first ^_^. 
 
 Classes also appeared in blackjack.py, though again, that was highly handheld by the course instructor.
