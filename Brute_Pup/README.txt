A web-hunting tool with bruteforce capabilities, and hooked into GoWitness.

Bruteforce multiple petabytes of potential sites and subdirectories, then check every combination for existence, and if it exists go take a picture! This usage is a bit extreme, but this is certainly a cool and functional apparatus for dirbusting/bruteforcing/OSINT.

Please see the header section of the code for its background information, the recipes menu for some various usage, and the -h in the code for extended usage.
